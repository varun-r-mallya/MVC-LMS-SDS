The source of the application discussed in the lecture is available at the following link https://github.com/ashpect/mvc-template. For the assignment, you need to create a Library Management System using the MVC architecture and MySQL. You are free to use any templating system that you like.
1. Create a user and admin panel separately. &#10003;
2. Virtual host the website on your laptop using the steps mentioned in the ReadMe &#10003;
3. Use Golang Migrate to create migrations file to perform DB changes. &#10003;
4. Write atleast one unit test for any function of you choice using the Golang Testing framework.&#10003;
5. Optimise your db architecture to avoid redundancy. &#10003;
While developing the project please keep the following points in mind :
1. Indent your code properly else we won’t be reviewing it. &#10003;
2. A README with setup instructions is compulsory and should have all the steps to set up your project successfully. Brownie points for anyone who automates this process. 
3. Bonus points for good global error handling. (ASK FOR REVIEW)
4. Do not commit files where you have stored your passwords. Add that filename to .gitignore or get a — on slack
Place the config files (sample vhost file, db username/passwords, etc) in another folder ‘config’.&#10003;
5. Make sure your vendor files are not uploaded.&#10003;
6. Again, Write good design. Plain HTML frontends won’t be reviewed. Ask seniors/designers to rate your app on basis of design and give suggestions.&#10003;
The soft deadline for the assignment is 4th July and the hard deadline is 6th July. You will need atleast one approving review from a 4y to submit the assignment. You are expected to get atleast one review before the soft deadline.
